# StellarisModManager

### Done
- Basic sorting/enabling/disabling functionality
- Cross-platform GUI using Avalonia (a working project using Blazor/Chromely exists in the archived folder)

### Todo (in order of priority)
- Drag/Drop sorting works on single items at the moment (as do the first four buttons on the left). Need to figure out how to re-implement multiple item drag/drop.
- Visual indicator for dependencies.
- Visual indicator for conflicts.
- Steam workshop integration.
